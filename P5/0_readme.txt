This is a description of how to run my codes.

1. There are five versions of my code. They are generally the same except for the difference in the robot.py code in each folder. I just modify the robot.py code to improve the performance of the robot.

2. In order to run the programs, it’s required to run the code by shell commands. First use cd (or other commands in different operating systems) to go to the working directory. Next use ‘python tester.py test_maze_01.txt’ command to try run robot on test mazes. There are four test mazes can be chosen from.

3. The codes are not that easy to read as simple supervised learning algorithms. I strongly recommends you to read my interpretation of the codes in the report. It’s easy and clear to understand. 

4. There structure of my code are almost the same. If you want to go deeper in my codes, I suggest you reading my best version of code: rule-based_version2.
